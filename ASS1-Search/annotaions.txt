SEARCH ALGORITHM
The algorithm should perform an alpha-beta pruning with some improvements in order to obtain a more optimized result.
HEURISTIC FUNCTION
The idea is to give an estimation of the most promising node at each level. A possible idea could be computing for each
configuration the points in this way:
P=sum(p(i)*(1/dist(f(i),posGreen)-1/dist(f(i),posRed)
